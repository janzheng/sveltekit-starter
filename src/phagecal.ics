DESCRIPTION:From the <a href="https://jgi.doe.gov/events/vega/"><u>Website<
 /u></a>:&nbsp\;<br><p>The VEGA 2022 symposium aims to bring together a “vir
 al ecogenomics” community to foster discussion on how to best capture and c
 haracterize uncultivated viruses\, understand the role of viruses in natura
 l ecosystems\, and functionally explore viral genetic diversity toward inno
 vative biotechnological and industrial applications. This 2022 edition will
  focus in particular on experimental innovations\, computational advances\,
  and other technological developments that will enable researchers to funct
 ionally characterize novel viral diversity and investigate virus-virus and 
 virus-host interactions in nature. The symposium will also include organize
 d discussion sessions to gather input from the community on the most pressi
 ng challenges faced by researchers in the viral ecogenomics fields.</p><p>P
 articipants will notably be invited to open discussions designed to shape t
 he future design of&nbsp\;<a href="https://img.jgi.doe.gov/vr/"><u><u>IMG/V
 R</u></u></a>&nbsp\;(the database of uncultivated viral genomes) to maximiz
 e its usefulness for the different actors in the field (i.e. gene-centric e
 xperimental approaches\, ecosystem models\, host-based evolutionary analysi
 s\, etc)\, as well as frame a potential viral-focused calls for projects at
  the JGI.</p>
